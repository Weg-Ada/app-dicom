# Web application for archiving medical images using the PACS system

The aim of the work was to create an IT system for archiving medical images using the PACS system (Picture Archiving and Communication System). The system is designed to support and archive all imaging examinations available on the end device, in accordance with the DICOM standard (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). The designed medical image archiving system has two user roles. They are the system administrator and the patient.

## PACS

The first systems were created in the 1980s. Their main tasks were data management and storage. At the same time, the introduction of the DICOM standard allowed for the integration of PACS networks and systems with the infrastructure of modern hospitals.

Basic PACS functions:

* archiving of images
* security of data components
* communication with diagnostic devices
* providing image data
* prefetching
* autorouting

## DICOM

In 1992, the third version of the ACR standard - NEMA, named after DICOM, was published. This opened the way to the full unification of the elements of the medical imaging system. The main tasks related to the use of imaging tests that have been set for the standard being created are the task of coherent archiving, i.e. a common database, a unified format for saving image data. Another task was communication, i.e. ensuring consistency between medical devices and the exchange of image data via protocols and a data server.
